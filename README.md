This repository contains labwork and project done in CS302 - Modelling and Simulation course.

Project :

In this course project we have implemented a model of vehicular traffic flow using cellular automata. We have implemented the Nagel-Schreckenberg Model for one lane, RNSL model for two lanes and DM model for three lanes. We have examined the influence on traffic flow due to slow vehicles and road blocks/accidents in a multi-lane system.
